# Final-Project
The raw dataset is in the data folder, and I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/gold-price-prediction-dataset

plotting.py, preprocessing.py, and feature_selection.py are modules used for eda_cleaning.ipynb

model_training.py is the main file for training the model, tuning hyperparameters, and creating PDPs
